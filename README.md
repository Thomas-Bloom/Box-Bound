# Box-Bound
This is a game I created in my space time and released onto the Google Play store

## How to build the project
1. Download a local copy of all the files in this repo
2. Open Unity and click open and select the root folder.
3. Once Unity has loaded, go to file -> Build Settings -> Build
4. An apk will then be created which can be installed on an Android device (Make sure to allow from external sources in the installer)
